Hi, Thanks for coming to my website here. Let me introduce myself.

My name is Nizar Baihaqi and i'm a Fullstack Developer. I have created several projects with Reactjs, Vuejs and Laravel. Maybe you can call it a Fullstack but now i'm focusing on Front-end section. Trying to improve my skill with Reactjs and Tailwindcss.

I have my journey blog here. I can say that i'm a web3 developer (drop a gm here if you interested). I have cover up things like connecting wallet and creating my own smart contract. 

As a Front-end i can design wireframe for mobile and desktop devices too. Communicating with API. Integrate web app to BaaS (Backend as a service) like Firebase or Supabase (firebase alternative). 

As a Backend too, i have been creating dashboard with Laravel and MySQL. Relational database makes me crazy, but i figure it out. I'm never learn further as professional Backend.

The point is.. That i can learn anything, sometime fast, sometime needs more time. But as long as new javascript framework isn't stop popping out. We're never gets enough to learn.
